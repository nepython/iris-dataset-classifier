### **WIP** Check back in a while

**It aims to classify given IRIS data into it's three species namely:**
1. Iris setosa
2. Iris virginica
3. Iris versicolor

**It would also be able to classify features such as:**
* Petal Length
* Petal Width
* Sepal Length
* Sepal Width

## Steps to get started:
`pip install -e .`

This will install `iris_dataset_classifier` while keeping it editable so that you can modify it as per your use :smile:

Ignore if you have already installed `tkinter` package

`sudo apt-get install python3-tk`

## Contributions
I am open to contributions :smiley:.
It need not be neccessarily in the form of code.
If you have any suggestion for enhancement/adding new features please open an issue for the same.
