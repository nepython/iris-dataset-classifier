# FINAL_NEURON

NOTE: The reason for not including `setosa` species is as it's already quite distinct from other two species.

I noticed it in many blogs/tutorials and have verified it first handed that `setosa` species can be saffely removed.
You can notice it with the below figure
<!-- Provide figure containg all 3 -->

These two were the most distinct features hence I have selected them
`petal_length` and `petal_width`
